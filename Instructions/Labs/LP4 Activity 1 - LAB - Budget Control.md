# Configure budget control

Budget control supports the management of a companyâ€™s financial resources
through the chart of accounts, workflows, user groups, source documents and
journals, configurable calculation of available funds, budget cycles, and
thresholds. When controls are in place, an organization can plan, measure,
manage, and forecast its financial resources throughout its fiscal year.

In this lab, we will describe how to configure budget control.

The process of configuring budget control involves the following steps:

-   Define budget control parameters.

-   Define over budget permissions.

-   Define budget funds.

-   Define documents and business transactions that require budget checking.

-   Define budget models.

-   Define budget control rules.

-   Activate budget control.

Use the USMF company for the exercises in this lab. In this lab, all
configuration is discussed. Some of the setup is already present in the legal
entity USMF, and some setup is not. The purpose of this lab is to show you all
the settings necessary for budget control.
