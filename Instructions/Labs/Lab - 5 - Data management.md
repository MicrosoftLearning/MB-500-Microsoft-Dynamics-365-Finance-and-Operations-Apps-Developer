## The Why

Effective data management is the backbone of any successful business operation, ensuring that data is accurate, accessible, and actionable. This hands-on lab will teach you how to manage data within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, a critical skill for maintaining data integrity and supporting business intelligence efforts. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to streamline data processes, enhance data quality, and provide valuable insights that drive informed decision-making. This practical knowledge will empower you to handle complex data management tasks with confidence, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and success of your organization.


## Business scenario

**Business Scenario**: Imagine you're a Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps administrator for a manufacturing company. You're facing challenges in managing your ever-growing data volume, including limited storage capacity, data inconsistency, and compliance risks.

**How can the Hands-on Exercise Help?** The hands-on exercise you linked provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the data management tools to address these challenges. By following the exercise, you'll learn how to effectively manage your data, optimizing storage usage, improving data quality, and mitigating compliance risks. This will ensure the continued smooth operation of your system and provide a reliable foundation for data-driven decision-making within your manufacturing company.


## Objective

This lab consists of several exercises.

Requirements are a working development virtual machine (VM) with access to the
finance and operations apps and Microsoft Office Excel.

In the first exercise, you’ll prepare to use Data Management by:

-   Refreshing the entity list.

-   Validating the working directory and access for service accounts.

-   Setting the **Ignore** error to yes to enable data to import with errors to
    a staging table.

-   Setting the **Create error file** to yes.

-   Setting **Remove duplicates** to yes to allow duplicates to import to a
    staging table, but not to have them updated in the table.

In the second exercise, you’ll prepare templates for the Data Management
framework, and then in the third exercise, you’ll import an Excel sheet with
data, which requires an Excel sheet with correct column names.

## Exercise 1: Prepare Data Management parameters

*Note:* If you get a "Your connection isn't private" error on browser opening, then select the **Advanced** link, select to **Continue**, then wait 2-3 minutes.

To prepare for configuration of Data Management parameters:

1.  Open Microsoft **Edge** on your VM and then enter
    **https://usnconeboxax1aos.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com/?cmp=USMF** in the
    address field.

2.  Select the **Data management** workspace, and then select the **Framework parameters**.

3.  Select the **Entity settings** tab, and then select **Refresh entity list**
    to refresh data entities in the system. Notice that data entities are now
    updated in the background as an asynchronous job. Get this started, as it takes several minutes.

4.  In the **Framework parameters**, navigate to the **General** tab, and then
    in the **Shared working directory** group, enter **c:\\temp\\dixf** for the
    path.

5.  Select **Validate** to confirm that the service account has access to the
    folder, and then configure the following parameters on the **General** tab,
    then **Save**:

    -   Ignore error: **Yes**

    -   Create error file (if available): **Yes**

    -   Remove duplicates: **Yes**

## Exercise 2: Prepare templates for Data Management

To prepare your templates to use Data Management:

1.  In the **Navigation pane**, select **Workspaces**, select **Data
    management**, and then select the **Templates** tile.

2.  Select the **Load default templates** action pane item.

3.  Find and select **140 – Accounts receivable**, select **Load selected**, and
    then wait for the **140 – Accounts receivable** template to load. When it
    completes you will see entities in the Entities list. (If you don't, then the entity
    list has probably not refreshed yet.)

5.  In the **Entities** list, **Select all**, and then navigate to **Customer
    groups**, and clear the **Customer groups** entity selection.

6.  Navigate to **Sales order pools**, clear the **Sales order pools** entity selection,
    and then select **Remove entity** at the entity list action bar. This will remove all entities
    _except for_ **Customer groups** and **Sales order pools**.

7.  Select **Yes** for the **Are you sure you want to delete all marked
    records** option, and then verify that only **Customer groups** and **Sales
    order pools** entities remain:

## Exercise 3: Create an import project

To create an import project:

1.  In the **Navigation pane**, select **Workspaces**, and then select **Data
    Management**.

2.  Select the **Export** tile to create an Excel sheet that provides the
    correct naming for columns.

3.  Enter **Group and pool** in the **Group name** field, and then enter
    **Customer group and order pools** in the **Description** field.

4.  In **Selected entities**, select **Add template**, and then in the **Copy
    from template** field, select the **140 – Account receivable** template
    which you created in Exercise 2.

5.  In the **Target data format** field, select **EXCEL**, and then select
    **OK**.

6.  In the upper action pane, select **Export now** and wait to see the
    Execution summary. (Make sure you select Export now to run it in
    interactive mode.)

7.  Under **Entity processing status**, select **Download file** for **Sales
    order pools**. Feel free to rename the file to Sales order pools or similar,
    leaving the extension. This will make it easier for you in future steps.

9.  For **Entity procession status**, select **Download file** for **Customer
    groups**. Feel free to rename the file to Customer groups or similar,
    leaving the extension.

10.  Open **File Explorer** on your VM, and then open the Excel file for **Sales
    order pools**. You can **Close** the Microsoft Office Activation Wizard if it appears and
    **Enable Editing**.
